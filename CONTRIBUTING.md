# How to Contribute

First off, thanks for taking interest in contributing! Here are some ways you can do it.

### Reporting Bugs

You can help a lot finding and reporting bugs, when reporting a bug, be sure to add as much reelevant information as you can, like **Framework**, **MapTool** and **Operating System** versions, how to reproduce the bug and provide any additional file.

Before oppening a bug report:

- **Make sure the bug is not already reported** searching on GitHub under Issues.
- **Check the FAQs on the Wiki** for a list of common questions and problems.
- **Do not open a bug report to ask questions**. Ask them on [RP Tools forum](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=28435) or MapTool's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hbn2bfn)

If you didn't find an existing issue for the problem, open a new one using the Bug report template and add a **clear title and decription**, including steps on how to reproduce the problem and MapTool and Framework versions.

### Suggesting Features

If you think the framework should have a feature that doesnt exist, feel free to suggest it.

Before oppening a feature request: 

- Check the **Wiki**, maybe the feature is already available.
- Check if the feature you want is not already requested searching on GitHub under Issues.

If the feature or request doesn't exist, open a new one using the Feature request template and add a **clear title and decription**, include why you think the feature is important and feel free to suggest how to implement it.

### Writing articles on the Wiki

Writing articles and guides on the wiki pages helps others to learn how to use the tools better, if you don't know where to start, open the Wiki and search for a topic that you understand, if it's incomplete, feel free to improve, if it doesn't exist, feel free to create a new page.

Before creating a new page:

- Be sure the subject isn't alredy adressed under another title.
- If you want to write about a workaround for a bug, or missing feature, open a bug repport or feature request instead.

You can also change the wikis to fix grammar and spelling, include clearer language or detail features.
