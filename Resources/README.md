# Other Resources

Here are some files that are not required to run the Framework, like numbers and letter images to place on dungeon areas, wiki images and dice audio clips, objects like trees, doors and stairs, textures like hatches and grass and some other tools.

## Markdown Notebook

This is a notebook that works like the notebook inside the framework, but adapted to be system agnostic, it does dice rolls, link to external websites, internal notes and tokens. It uses Markdown Syntax so it is easy to use and compatible with other Markdown editors.

## DDB Importer

This is an importer from D&D Beyound for monsters and spells, but also works with other external content, such as PDFs and anything formated like a statblock, just copy the content, paste in the importer and select a category. It is included in Framework version 2.5.3 or newer by default but also works on older versions, and can be adapted for other frameworks with a bestiary or spellbook if needed.
