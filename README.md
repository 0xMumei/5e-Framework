# 5e-Framework

A comprehensive 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Framework for MapTool with character sheet and character creation tools, a compendium of items, features, spells and creatures and campaign management tools.

The framework can also be found at https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=28435

## Versions

## Resources

This folder contains images that are not framework-specific, that I use to create maps and adventures
