Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\n\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\n\n***Heavy.*** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\nLoading.

Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.\n\n***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

A gaming set has all the pieces needed to play a specific game or type of game, such as a complete deck of cards or a board and tokens.\n\n***History.*** Your mastery of a game includes knowledge of its history, as well as of important events it was connected to or prominent historical figures involved with it.\n\n***Insight.*** Playing games with someone is a good way to gain understanding of their personality, granting you a better ability to discern their lies from their truths and read their mood.\n\n***Sleight of Hand.*** Sleight of Hand is a useful skill for cheating at a game, as it allows you to swap pieces, palm cards, or alter a die roll. Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt.\n\n##### Gaming Set\n\n|Activity|DC|\n|---|---:|\n|Catch a player cheating|15|\n|Gain insight into an opponent's personality|15|","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"riding horse":{"description":"*Mount*  \n75 gp  \nSpeed: 60, Carrying Capacity: 480 lb.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"cart":{"description":"*Vehicle (land)*  \n15 gp, 200 lb.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"feed (per day)":{"description":"*Tack and harness*  \n5 cp, 10 lb.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"riding saddle":{"description":"*Tack and harness*  \n10 gp, 25 lb.","sources":["SRD","PHB"]},"rowboat":{"description":"*Vehicle (water)*  \n50 gp, 100 lb.  \nSpeed: 1½ mph  \nCarrying Capacity: 3 passengers  \nCrew 1, AC 11, HP 50  \n\n---\n\nKeelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers, If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.\n\n***Crew.*** A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to function. As per the Player's Handbook, one skilled hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel.\nYou can track the loyalty of individual crew members or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members leave the ship and never return.\n\n***Passengers.*** This indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate.\nAccommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters.

If a ship has a Damage Threshold, it has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal.

Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long).
